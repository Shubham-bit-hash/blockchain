# Blockchain

## Description
This project aims to build a simple blockchain to help you learn about blockchain technology.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Shubham-bit-hash/blockchain.git
     ```
   - This will create a local copy of your project.

2. **Initialize npm:**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd blockchain
     ```
   - Initialize npm by running:
     ```
     npm init -y
     ```
   

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - To use cryptographic functions, you can choose between `crypto` (built-in Node.js module) or `crypto-js`.
   - If you prefer `crypto`, This package is no longer supported. It's now a built-in Node module. If you've depended on crypto, better u can use `crypto-js`.
   - If you want to use `crypto-js`, install it using:
     ```
     npm install crypto-js
     ```

4. **Usage:**
   - Provide clear instructions on how to run your blockchain code.
   - Explain how to interact with your blockchain (e.g., adding blocks, validating transactions).
